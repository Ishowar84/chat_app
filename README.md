## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
-   A code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
-   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account (it's free to start).

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend folder
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend folder from the root
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Firebase:**
    -   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    -   **For the Backend (Admin SDK):**
        -   In your Firebase project, go to **Project Settings > Service accounts**.
        -   Click **Generate new private key** and download the JSON file.
        -   Place this file in your `server` directory. **Important:** Add the filename to your `.gitignore` file to keep it private!
    -   **For the Frontend (Client SDK):**
        -   In your Firebase project, go to **Project Settings > General**.
        -   Click the **Web** icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
        -   Copy the `firebaseConfig` object provided. You will need this for the frontend.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    -   In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file by copying the example:
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Edit the `.env` file and add the path to your Firebase service account key:
        ```
        # .env file in /server directory
        FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH="./your-service-account-file-name.json"
        ```
    -   In the `client` directory, find the Firebase initialization script (e.g., `firebase-init.js` or `main.js`) and paste your `firebaseConfig` object there.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    # From the /server directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend:**
    -   Open the `index.html` file in the `client` directory with a live server extension (like the one in VS Code).
    -   Or, if you have a build tool, run its dev command:
    ```sh
    # From the /client directory
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the App:**
    -   Open your browser and navigate to the address provided by your frontend server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
    -   Open multiple browser tabs to simulate a conversation between different users.
